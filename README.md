# VKRT
Game Engine / Rendering Pipeline Experiments
Goal:
- Support OS - Win10, OSX, Ubuntu
- Support API - Vulkan Raster, Vulkan Ray Trace (compute), Dx12, DXR
- (near) Instant API switches.
- Functional hitboxes, movement, animations
- Asset Streaming (loose file dependencies)

Todo:
- Finish refactoring
- EngineEntity needs to store tinyobj and stbi
- Abstract out parts
- Build menu system
- Way too much else
